## EXAPUNKS Bonus

If you enjoyed playing with the EXA language, you may wish to purchase and
play [EXAPUNKS]. In the real game, a single EXA is only
_one_ of potentially _many_ interconnected EXAs! This adds a whole new level
of richness to the idea, of which these challenges only scratched the surface.
Zachtronics' world of EXAs has a lot more to offer.

If you're already an EXAPUNK veteran, you will have already noticed the
simplifications made in this exercise. Here are some more advanced features
you could implement from the game:

* Support for other misc instructions (`SWIZ`, `HALT`, `NOTE`, `NOOP`, `RAND`)
* `@` macro instructions for code repetition
* Simulation of hosts and movement with `LINK` and `HOST`
* Support for keyword values (a.k.a. strings)
* Support for `MAKE` and `DROP` (create/delete files)
* Support for hardware registers (read-only or write-only)
* Accurate runtime errors
* And the ultimate challenge: proper full EXA-VM simulation
  * Have swarms of EXAs with their programs properly in sync
  * `REPL` and `KILL` support for forking and termination
  * Support for the `M` register and `MODE`

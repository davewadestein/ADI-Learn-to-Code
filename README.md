* __Google Colaboratory__ link: https://colab.research.google.com/github/davewadestein/ADI-Learn-to-Code/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Programming.ipynb

# or locally on your machine...
* install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* install Anaconda (600+ MB) (https://www.anaconda.com/)
* install Python (www.python.org) + install Jupyter
   * on Windows, probably __`pip install jupyterlab`__ from a DOS/command window

# Some Terminology
* "Pythonic"
  * a coding style that leverages Python's unique features to write code that is readable and beautiful.
  * writing code in a way that experienced Python programmers would write it
  * idiomatic
* BDFL = Benevolent Dictator for Life (formerly Guido van Rossum)
  * Guido stepped down as BDFL in 2019 due to social media harrassment after a contentious PEP was approved

# Important points about teaching/learning
* if you can't explain it in lay terms, you don't truly understand it
* you must zoom in/out as needed
  * don't zoom in until it matters
  * do/don't go down the rabbit hole

# Some formatting rules for Python
* variables only use lower case and underscores, e.g., year, cost, cost_per_ounce
* things you want to identify as constants would be all upper case, e.g., ROUTING_NUMBER

# Best practices for programming
 * "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." –Hal Abelson
 * Eagleson's Law: "Any code you wrote more than 6 months ago might as well have been written by someone else"
 * Prefer clear code over comments
 * Variable names–they should be descriptive
 * Follow formatting rules for your language
   * get a plug-in to make it a non-issue
 * DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
 * According to DWS: You need "mechanical sympathy" to excel at programming or a programming language
   * Jackie Stewart
 * "Performance doesn't matter until it matters, and it rarely matters." –DWS

# Important things about Python
* "truthiness"
  * any nonzero number is True (0, 0.0 are False)
  * a nonempty container is True (empty container is False)
* Python is "Duck Typed"
* built-in functions cannot change ("mutate") objects (e.g., _sorted()_)
  * corollary 1: in order to change an object you need a method (e.g., _.append()_ ... "mutator")
  * corollary 2: not all methods change their objects (e.g., _.count()_ ... "inspector")

# Python Types
* Immutable vs. Mutable Types
  * mutable: list
  * immutable: strings
* simple types (scalars) vs. containers
  * simple types: int, float, bool
  * containers: str, list, dict

# Walrus Operator
  * add this
  * 
# What tools/skills do I need to be a good programmer?
* good problems-solving skills
  * ability to break things into smaller pieces
  * methodical / attention to detail
* perseverance
* not math sense, per se

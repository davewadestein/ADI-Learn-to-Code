# Important points about teaching/learning
* if you can't explain it in lay terms, you don't truly understand it
* you must zoom in/out as needed
  * don't zoom in until it matters
  * do/don't go down the rabbit hole

# Some formatting rules for Python
* variable only use lower case, e.g., year, cost, cost_per_ounce
* things you want to identify as constants would be all upper case, e.g., ROUTING_NUMBER

# Best practices for programming
 * "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." –Hal Abelson
 * Prefer clear code over comments
 * Variable names–they should be descriptive

# Python "truthiness"
* any nonzero number is True (0, 0.0 are False)
* a nonempty string is True (empty string is False)

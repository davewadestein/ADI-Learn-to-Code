# BDFL = Benevolent Dictator for Life (formerly Guido van Rossum)
* Guido stepped down as BDFL in 2019 due to social media harrassment after a PEP was approved

# Important points about teaching/learning
* if you can't explain it in lay terms, you don't truly understand it
* you must zoom in/out as needed
  * don't zoom in until it matters
  * do/don't go down the rabbit hole

# Some formatting rules for Python
* variable only use lower case, e.g., year, cost, cost_per_ounce
* things you want to identify as constants would be all upper case, e.g., ROUTING_NUMBER

# Best practices for programming
 * "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." –Hal Abelson
 * Eagleson's Law: "Any code you wrote more than 6 months ago might as well have been written by someone else"
 * Prefer clear code over comments
 * Variable names–they should be descriptive
 * Follow formatting rules for your language
   * get a plug-in to make it a non-issue
 * DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself

# Python "truthiness"
* any nonzero number is True (0, 0.0 are False)
* a nonempty string is True (empty string is False)

# Python Types
* Immutable vs. Mutable Types
  * mutable:
  * immutable: strings
* simple types (scalars) vs. containers
  * simple types: int, float, bool
  * containers: str

# What tools/skills do I need to be a good programmer?
* good problems-solving skills
  * ability to break things into smaller pieces
  * methodical / attention to detail
* perseverance
* not math sense, per se

# "Pythonic"
* writing code in a way that experienced Python programmers would write it
* idiomatic
